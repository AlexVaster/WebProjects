          <h3 id="article">Here's a time line of Steve's life:</h3>
          <li>
            <strong>1955</strong> - Born in San Francisco, California, U.S.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1968</strong> - Jobs was given a summer job by Bill Hewlett
            (of Hewlett-Packard) after Jobs cold-called him to ask for parts for
            an electronics project
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1971</strong> - After Wozniak began attending University of
            California, Berkeley, Jobs would visit him there a few times a week.
            This experience led him to study in nearby Stanford University's
            student union
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1975</strong> - Jobs and Wozniak attended meetings of the
            Homebrew Computer Club which was a stepping stone to the development
            and marketing of the first Apple computer.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1976</strong> - Wozniak designed and developed the Apple I
            computer and showed it to Jobs, who suggested that they sell it.
            Jobs, Wozniak, and Ronald Wayne founded Apple Computer (now called
            Apple Inc.) in the garage of Jobs's Los Altos home on Crist Drive.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1977</strong> - Jobs and Wozniak introduced the Apple II at
            the West Coast Computer Faire. It was the first consumer product
            sold by Apple Computer and was one of the first highly successful
            mass-produced microcomputer products in the world.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1984</strong> - Apple introduced the Macintosh, which was
            based on The Lisa (and Xerox PARC's mouse-driven graphical user
            interface) and conceived by early Apple employee Jef Raskin
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1985</strong> - Jobs submitted a letter of resignation to
            the Apple Board. Five additional senior Apple employees also
            resigned and joined Jobs in his new venture, NeXT.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1990</strong> - NeXT workstations were first released in
            1990 and priced at US$9,999. Like the Apple Lisa, the NeXT
            workstation was technologically advanced and designed for the
            education sector, but was largely dismissed as cost-prohibitive for
            educational institutions.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1996</strong> - Apple announced that it would buy NeXT for
            $427 million.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>2005</strong> - Jobs responded to criticism of Apple's poor
            recycling programs for e-waste in the US by lashing out at
            environmental and other advocates at Apple's annual meeting in
            Cupertino in April.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>2011</strong> - Jobs died at the age of 56 from pancreatic
            cancer
          </li>
        </ul>
