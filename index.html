        <div id="article">Here's a time line of Steve's life:</div>
        <li><b>1955</b> - Born in San Francisco, California, U.S.</li>
        <li>
          <b>1968</b> - Jobs was given a summer job by Bill Hewlett (of
          Hewlett-Packard) after Jobs cold-called him to ask for parts for an
          electronics project
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>1971</b> - After Wozniak began attending University of California,
          Berkeley, Jobs would visit him there a few times a week. This
          experience led him to study in nearby Stanford University's student
          union
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>1975</b> - Jobs and Wozniak attended meetings of the Homebrew
          Computer Club which was a stepping stone to the development and
          marketing of the first Apple computer.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>1976</b> - Wozniak designed and developed the Apple I computer and
          showed it to Jobs, who suggested that they sell it. Jobs, Wozniak, and
          Ronald Wayne founded Apple Computer (now called Apple Inc.) in the
          garage of Jobs's Los Altos home on Crist Drive.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>1977</b> - Jobs and Wozniak introduced the Apple II at the West
          Coast Computer Faire. It was the first consumer product sold by Apple
          Computer and was one of the first highly successful mass-produced
          microcomputer products in the world.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>1984</b> - Apple introduced the Macintosh, which was based on The
          Lisa (and Xerox PARC's mouse-driven graphical user interface) and
          conceived by early Apple employee Jef Raskin
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>1985</b> - Jobs submitted a letter of resignation to the Apple
          Board. Five additional senior Apple employees also resigned and joined
          Jobs in his new venture, NeXT.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>1990</b> - NeXT workstations were first released in 1990 and priced
          at US$9,999. Like the Apple Lisa, the NeXT workstation was
          technologically advanced and designed for the education sector, but
          was largely dismissed as cost-prohibitive for educational
          institutions.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>1996</b> - Apple announced that it would buy NeXT for $427 million.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>2005</b> - Jobs responded to criticism of Apple's poor recycling
          programs for e-waste in the US by lashing out at environmental and
          other advocates at Apple's annual meeting in Cupertino in April.
        </li>
        <li><b>2011</b> - Jobs died at the age of 56 from pancreatic cancer</li>
